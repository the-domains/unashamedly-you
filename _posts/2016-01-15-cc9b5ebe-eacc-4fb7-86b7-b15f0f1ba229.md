My sister thought I laughed too loud in the street

My ex-husband did not want me to talk about entities, aliens or energy at dinner with our friends

My grandmother called me a witch when I said I could heal her with my hands

Does that sound familiar? The first 38 years of my life I thought something was wrong with me. I did not fit anywhere, there was always someone who thought I should be less loud, less strange and more normal.

In the picture below I was about 6 years old and I was parading on a flower cart in the South of France. That look is typical me. I was present but I was also somewhere else. In that picture I am unashamedly me. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9530ff84-50ba-4c14-a61a-8f93f418725e.jpg)

Unashamedly me does not have to look so weird that it separates me from people. It just means I am being me at all times.

Why choose to be unashamedly you? Besides finally feeling free, it also means more joy, more money and more ease. 

More on that later....

This book will give you tools and exercises to find out what unshamadely you looks like for you. 

Are you ready?
